The trend seems to be increasingly specific, when we should be getting more general. Right now, people must work to understand the system. We must spend too much time adninistering the system, labeling and cleaning our files. Complying is a real burden, both for the individual and for the records coordinators. Describe Possible Solutions And Benefits 1. Drop the category specifications altogether. 2.
